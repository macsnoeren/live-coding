# Live Coding
Within Avans University of Applied Sciences, we are busy to reinvent the education of software engineering. Change from the classical way of education to a more interactive way of education. Where learning by experiments and practice is the key element of the education. We believe that software skills can only be learned when you practice a lot ... yes ... a lot!

While there already exist some (free) browser based compilers, these applications did not fully comply to the requirements we have as teachers. We would like to have a tool that enables us to start practice with our students. During this practice it should be easy to see the progress of each student, help them when they are stuck and provide education for all students.  

Based on the research of Maurice Snoeren within the field of learning by doing,a "Live Coding" pilot has been started in 2008 with a simple real-time application that implemented the idea that we had. Live coding with our students and provide the required feedback and education to help them becoming great skilled software developers. The first year, students provided a lot of feedback and the Live Coding application has become more mature.

## Everyone enthousiast
Within the Netherlands different Univesities of Applied Sciences uses Live Coding during their lectures. Collaboration is on the way and we would like to make the next step to make it more easier for students and lecturers to provide interactive coding lessons. We can conclude that this form opens new oppertunities and improvement to the currect education of software engineering.

## Beta version
Just note that this application is far from finished! Use it at your own risk. We use it in our own education and to experiment with new didactical concept to train our student on coding skills.

## Live Coding Approach
We need to have an approach of the Live Coding application.

### Background
At Avans University of Applied Sciences, we educate students in the field of software engineering. Coding is a skill that our students need to develop during the first year already. During the second year we broaden these skills.

### Problem definition
Software eduction at this moment consist of theoretical (3 hours) and practical (2 hours) lessons. Besides these lessons, the students execute assignments at home (3 hours). It is the classical way of education. The last years, the students are not coming to the practical lessons and stay behind with the assignments. Becoming a great skilled software engineer, required practice and code a lot to get the required experience. The skills of the students are lagging and during the second and third year, these students cannot keep up very well.

### Research
Learning is a process that changes the knowledge, beliefs, behaviours or attitudes of students. The student are owner of their own process and is done together with fellow students and teachers. We would like to develop an effective tool to increase the learning performance of our students. Therefore we take the practical research approach. The hypothesis is that, when students get started right away with the theory with challenging assignments, together with direct feedback from the teacher, the learning performance improves. Using an active teaching method during the lessons, is one of the main focus points of this study. We will start with the following research question:

_**What are the most (evidence based) effective education strategies for the education of software skills (coding) of students with no prior knowledge?**_

Currently, we have defined the following sub-questions:
1. What are effective education strategies to learn coding skills.
2. How can digital tools support these effective education strategies to learn coding skills?
3. What kind of digital tools can be developed to support the teacher and students?

### Goal
The goal is to provide an Intenet based tool, that can be used by lecturers to teach student software skills, to significantly improve the learning performance of the students compared to classical education.  

### ...some thoughts
* Interactive (or constructive feedback) should follow from the literature
* It would be nice when it is also possible to differentiate. So, when a student does not fully understand a subject, more practice is given.
* Interesting web site focussing on programming skills: https://www.java67.com/2016/02/5-books-to-improve-coding-skills-of.html
* Interesting article on improving coding skills as beginner: https://medium.com/skilluped/a-beginners-guide-on-how-to-improve-your-programming-skills-769b92fef2f2
* Different subjects with assignments
* https://code.org/hourofcode/overview
* https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/middle-high
* Show participation graph or figure. How much students are really active with the assignment? Maybe a participation list of students priotized in participation.
* Een les kunnen configureren met video's met theorie en opdrachten die daarna komen. Dat ze deze video's van te voren kunnen kijken en met de docent door de
opdrachten kan komen. De docent gaat er ook door heen en doet een paar voorbeelden. Het systeem geeft aan het gaat en selecteert moeilijkere of makkelijkere opdrachten.

# What are effective education strategies to learn coding skills.
Within this section we will explore what effective education strategies are to learn coding skills. Exploring the literature to find the answer to this question is important. Therefore a desk research has been executed to get the required literature.

## How do we learn coding skills the best?
Practice (Forest, 2019) 
* If you want to become an expert programmer, be ready to spend at least 5 years of programming daily.
* Programming is one of these skills where you will need to practice a lot more than focus on the theory. I then recommend you spend at least 80% of your time writing code and 20% learning the theory. 
* For every minute you spend trying to understand the concepts, you should spend about 5x more time on putting it into practice. 
* The golden rule is spaced learning and spaced repetition. This means you should spread out your learning in short bursts to let your brain time to assimilate the concepts. And you should recall what you learned regularly enough.
* Program every day
* How can I become a good programmer?
    * Write clean code like a champ
    * Abstraction and encapsulation. Hide implementation details.
    * Name your boolean conditions.
    * Name your actions
    * The rule of 7 (lines of code per function)
    * Maintainability

(Upadhyay, 2020):
* follow the project-based learning approach. Build as many projects as you can to strengthen your problem-solving skills in programming. Remember that programming is not about learning a language (Python, C++, Java, etc.), it is the ability to solve the problems. Also in a job, an employer needs a problem solver so, during interviews, your problem-solving skill comes first before anything else.

* Adapt a good learning strategy. For example: instead of consuming all the theories first and then jumping to making the programs follow a 2:1 ratio between conceptual learning and active learning. It means after every two hours of conceptual learning spend an hour in practical exposure or active learning.
* Make a small application or project based on fundamentals you have learned. For example, make a calculator or something that is interesting for you. Learn how to google when you get stuck somewhere.
* Practice, practice and practice enough. Get your hands dirty in programming and if it’s possible participate in competitive programming on different websites. You will gain confidence and you will become much better in problem-solving.

* Plan your code away from the computer. It will help you build a clear mental model before you start. You use the same strategy in writing, because if you don’t have an outline, your content becomes a messy stream of consciousness.
* The best programmers can take a complex problem, break it down into smaller pieces, solve each of those pieces, and then put everything back together to solve the initial problem.

https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/features/coding-education-important-implemented/:
* oding bootcamps have gained popularity over the past four or five years as a way to help students from all backgrounds learn coding and pursue careers in software development. Most programs last about three months on average and can be full-time, part-time, online or in-person.

John Hattie:
* "Pas als je als leerkracht heel goed weet wat een leerling wel en niet weet, kun je hem effectief nieuwe dingen leren. Als je als het ware door de ogen van een leerling kijkt en de leerling duidelijk maakt wat het doel is waar hij naartoe werkt, kun je hem de juiste opdrachten en feedback geven om effectief iets nieuws te leren."
* Hoe doe je dat in de les?
"Het betekent dat je als leraar heel goed moet luisteren, en veel ruimte moet creëren voor groepsdiscussies. Niet omdat wat leerlingen te melden hebben per definitie super-interessant is, maar omdat je er dan achter komt of wat jij als leerkracht wilde overbrengen ook daadwerkelijk is geland, of er vooruitgang is geboekt.
* "Dat is heel lastig voor leraren, zij hebben vaak de neiging om in te grijpen en de discussie de goede kant op te sturen. Maar als je je mond houdt, hoor je de invloed van je onderwijs. Goede leraren zijn daar voortdurend naar op zoek."
* 

https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-teach-code-a4d8ee29e14e:
* Learning to code is really hard and teaching code is even harder. There is no bootcamp in ‘How to Teach Code’. Most teachers do not have any formal training in education and come from a software background.

## Security considerations

While the environment is able to dispatch multiple connections and accept multiple compiler
servers to perform the compiling tasks, your systems are at risk. Security needs to be taken
into account running these services. Some of the security recommendations are taken into 
account within the software:
1. The compiling server software uses a time limited sandbox to execute the compiled source code
2. The compiling server should run in a Virtual Machine, so it is easy to recover them if broken
3. ... <definitely not complete>

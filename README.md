# Live Coding
Within Avans University of Applied Sciences, we are busy to reinvent the education of software engineering. Change from the classical way of education to a more interactive way of education. Where learning by experiments and practice is the key element of the education. We believe that software skills can only be learned when you practice a lot ... yes ... a lot!

While there already exist some (free) browser based compilers, these applications did not fully comply to the requirements we have as teachers. We would like to have a tool that enables us to start practice with our students. During this practice it should be easy to see the progress of each student, help them when they are stuck and provide education for all students.  

Based on the research of Maurice Snoeren within the field of learning by doing,a "Live Coding" pilot has been started in 2008 with a simple real-time application that implemented the idea that we had. Live coding with our students and provide the required feedback and education to help them becoming great skilled software developers. The first year, students provided a lot of feedback and the Live Coding application has become more mature.

## Everyone enthousiast
Within the Netherlands different Univesities of Applied Sciences uses Live Coding during their lectures. Collaboration is on the way and we would like to make the next step to make it more easier for students and lecturers to provide interactive coding lessons. We can conclude that this form opens new oppertunities and improvement to the currect education of software engineering.

## Beta version
Just note that this application is far from finished! Use it at your own risk. We use it in our own education and to execite experiments with new didactical concept to train our student on coding skills.

## The live coding approach
What should be developed and what kind of solutions should we create? We need to have an approach for the Live Coding application, otherwise the development is not structures and our goals are not fullfilled. The development of Live Coding is an outcome of our research we do to how student should be teached coding skills. More detail of this research can be found [here](RESEARCH.md).

## Security considerations

While the environment is able to dispatch multiple connections and accept multiple compiler
servers to perform the compiling tasks, your systems are at risk. Security needs to be taken
into account running these services. show the importance of the learning activities to the students. Some of the ssecurity recommendations are taken into 
account within the software:
1. The compiling server software uses a time limited sandbox to execute the compiled source code
2. The compiling server should run in a Virtual Machine, so it is easy to recover them if broken
3. ... <definitely not complete>

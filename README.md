# Live Coding

Live coding ... why? For us teachers who would like to teach coding in an interactive way
during the class. The coding of the students can be viewed and discussed to increase the
learning of the total group. Within Avans Hogeschool, this software has been developed and
used already for three years. Each year the software is step-by-step improved together with
students and teachers that are involved. 

Teachers use the tool to interactively learn the basic skills to their students. Students 
are able to code along the course. The teacher is able to see the progress in real-time. Using
this method provides a good measure of the possible pace and how well your students are doing.
Going into detail of the current student challenge's creates a steep learning environment.

## Beta version

This is application is not yet finished! Use at your own risk. We use it to experiment with
new didactical concepts within our education concepts. Therefore, it is in a beta state.

## Security considerations

While the environment is able to dispatch multiple connections and accept multiple compiler
servers to perform the compiling tasks, your systems are at risk. Security needs to be taken
into account running these services. Some of the security recommendations are taken into 
account within the software:
1. The compiling server software uses a time limited sandbox to execute the compiled source code
2. The compiling server should run in a Virtual Machine, so it is easy to recover them if broken
3. ... <definitely not complete>

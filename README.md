# Live Coding
Within Avans University of Applied Sciences, we are busy to reinvent the education of software engineering. Change from the classical way of education to a more interactive way of education. Where learning by experiments and practice is the key element of the education. We believe that software skills can only be learned when you practice a lot ... yes ... a lot!

While there already exist some (free) browser based compilers, these applications did not fully comply to the requirements we have as teachers. We would like to have a tool that enables us to start practice with our students. During this practice it should be easy to see the progress of each student, help them when they are stuck and provide education for all students.  

Based on the research of Maurice Snoeren within the field of learning by doing,a "Live Coding" pilot has been started in 2008 with a simple real-time application that implemented the idea that we had. Live coding with our students and provide the required feedback and education to help them becoming great skilled software developers. The first year, students provided a lot of feedback and the Live Coding application has become more mature.

## Everyone enthousiast
Within the Netherlands different Univesities of Applied Sciences uses Live Coding during their lectures. Collaboration is on the way and we would like to make the next step to make it more easier for students and lecturers to provide interactive coding lessons. We can conclude that this form opens new oppertunities and improvement to the currect education of software engineering.

## Beta version
Just note that this application is far from finished! Use it at your own risk. We use it in our own education and to execite experiments with new didactical concept to train our student on coding skills.

## The live coding approach
What should be developed and what kind of solutions should we create? We need to have an approach for the Live Coding application, otherwise the development is not structures and our goals are not fullfilled. The development of Live Coding is an outcome of our research we do to how student should be teached coding skills. More detail of this research can be found [here](RESEARCH.md). 

## Requirements
Based on the research the following requires have been defined for the live coding application:
* The teacher is able to create a named class room.
* The students are able to log into the named class room to participate with the coding class of the teacher.
* The teacher is able to see all the students that have been logged into the class room.
* The teacher is able to show coding examples and run them.
* The student is able to code along with the teacher and run the code.
* The teacher is able to send the code to the students.
* The student is able to grab the code that is sent.
* It is possible to compile and run console applications.
* Running the code will not have any security issues on the server, student or teacher machine.
* The teacher is able to select a workshop that contains assignments.
* The students can follow the order of the assignments the teacher has created.
* The teacher and the students are able to follow the progress of the students.
* The teacher is able to see the assignments of the students and give feedback in the code, or within the class.
* The teacher is able to see what the student is doing at this moment when the student is selected.
* The teacher and the students is ablt to see the progress of their learning in the context of the subjects.
* The code is validated by a unit test to check the result of the student.
* The teacher and student is able to create multiple files within the browser.
* The teacher and student is able to save the current state and when revisit the page everything is reloaded.
* The teacher is able to create workshops with assignments with a specific flow.
* Assignments are marked with a level, if a student has finished x assignment of a certain level, the system go to the next level (differentiate).
* Assignments have a title, explanation, video, ... (extra explanation)
* Workshop have learning goals, ...
* Students can ask for help, other students (and teacher) can help the student and chat with the student.
* Student can grab the code from the teacher and students.
* Teacher is able to give good feedback to the student.
* Teacher is able to see an overview of the progress of the students.
* Teacher is able to see activities of the students.

# Research to effective education strategies for teaching coding skills
_Maurice Snoeren_<br>
This document describes the research that is done to get insights to improve our education of software coding.

## Live coding approach
We need to have an approach of the Live Coding application, otherwise the development is not structures and our goals are not fullfilled. In order to understand where we come from and why some design decisions have been made, this section shows the details about the background, problem definition and the research behind the tool.

### Background
At Avans University of Applied Sciences, we educate students in the field of software engineering. Coding is a skill that our students need to develop during the first year already. During the second year we broaden these skills.

### Problem definition
Software eduction at this moment consist of theoretical (3 hours) and practical (2 hours) lessons. Besides these lessons, the students execute assignments at home (3 hours). It is the classical way of education. The last years, the students are not coming to the practical lessons and stay behind with the assignments. Becoming a great skilled software engineer, required practice and code a lot to get the required experience. The skills of the students are lagging and during the second and third year, these students cannot keep up very well.

### Research
Learning is a process that changes the knowledge, beliefs, behaviours or attitudes of students. The student are owner of their own process and is done together with fellow students and teachers. We would like to develop an effective tool to increase the learning performance of our students. Therefore we take the practical research approach. The hypothesis is that, when students get started right away with the theory with challenging assignments, together with direct feedback from the teacher, the learning performance improves. Using an active teaching method during the lessons, is one of the main focus points of this study. We will start with the following research question:

_**What are the most (evidence based) effective education strategies for the education of software skills (coding) of students with no prior knowledge?**

Currently, we have defined the following sub-questions:
1. How can we get motivated students?
2. What are effective education strategies to learn coding skills.
3. How can digital tool support these effective education strategies to learn coding skills?
4. What kind of digital tools can be developed to support the teacher and students to develop their coding skills?

### Goal
The goal is to provide an Intenet based tool, that can be used by lecturers to teach student software skills, to significantly improve the learning performance of the students compared to classical education.  

### ...some thoughts
* Interactive (or constructive feedback) should follow from the literature
* It would be nice when it is also possible to differentiate. So, when a student does not fully understand a subject, more practice is given.
* Interesting web site focussing on programming skills: https://www.java67.com/2016/02/5-books-to-improve-coding-skills-of.html
* Interesting article on improving coding skills as beginner: https://medium.com/skilluped/a-beginners-guide-on-how-to-improve-your-programming-skills-769b92fef2f2
* Different subjects with assignments
* https://code.org/hourofcode/overview
* https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/middle-high
* Show participation graph or figure. How much students are really active with the assignment? Maybe a participation list of students priotized in participation.
* Een les kunnen configureren met video's met theorie en opdrachten die daarna komen. Dat ze deze video's van te voren kunnen kijken en met de docent door de
opdrachten kan komen. De docent gaat er ook door heen en doet een paar voorbeelden. Het systeem geeft aan het gaat en selecteert moeilijkere of makkelijkere opdrachten.
* Mogelijkheid om feedback te geven.

# 1. How can we get motivated students?
Within this section we will explore what effective education strategies are to learn coding skills. Exploring the literature to find the answer to this question is important. Therefore a desk research has been executed to get the required literature.

## Do students have motivation problems?
In contrast to the rest of the wolrd, within The Netherlands it is seen that teachers suffer from motivational problems by their students. A Dutch study shows a big challenge within the Dutch education, is to motivate the students (Onderwijsinspectie, 2015). Showing no interest in the class and already satisfied when they pass the test with a low mark. Motivation has a direct relation with the learning performance of the students. Other research over the world shows that teachers often experience motivation problems with their students (Ryan & Deci, 2000) (Marzano & Miedema, 2013) (Joosten & van Laar, 2015). Therefore, special attention should be spend to motivate students when implementing a new approach for learning code. 

## Are the students really not motivated?
Always a struggle! Are the students not motivated or are the teachers not doing the right things to get the students motivated. Eventually, it is the problem of the student and it is possible that the student is not able to become successfull in the society. Or do we have then a problem as society and the teacher should have prevented this? The literature teaches us that the teacher do have a large impact on the motivation of the students (Joosten & van Laar, 2015). Yes we can motivate our students!

## How we currently try to motivate our students?
Within our ecuation we use rewards and punish methods. When students do a good job we give them compliments. An exam or assessment is rewarded with a mark. When the student gets a low mark, he failed to pass the exam. So we punish the student to do the exam again ... and again if he fails again. In our online assignments, the students get green sphere (reward) when they pass the assignment and a red sphere (punish) when the failed the assignment. They do have unlimited trials to pass the assignment. We hope that students get motivated by all these aspects of our education.

## Rewards for learning skills work counterproductive
Pink teaches us that when students have tasks that require conceptual and creative thinking, rewards are counterproductive (Pink 2010). The greater the reward, the worse the student performance become. Learning to code requires conceptual and creative thinking! The research of Hattie shows that feedback based on compliments (and punishment) are the least effective methods to improve the learning performance of a student (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Dweck shows us that compliments could lead to the development of a fixed mindset. Students with a fixed mindset will not face large challenges that learning the code will rise (Dweck, 2006).

## Can we motivate our students?
It seems that our current education contains a lot of extrinsic motivation aspects. Extrinsic motivation does not lead to genuine interest of the student (Rayen & Deci, 2000). Marzano is convinced that students coming to school to get motivated. Motivation is not a quality of the student, but created by the teacher, student and learning activities. The student has an important role and own responsibility and it is a learning process of the student. The teacher is able to support this proces. Therefore, the teacher has a large impact on the motivation of the students to support the students to take their own role and responsibility for their own learning process.

Pink gives three important factors that improve the learning performance of the students:
1. Autonomy: This is about how students are able to control and make their own decisions.
2. Mastery: This is about the will to get better in something. Why student go with great pleasure to their football training ... and not the coding class?
3. Meaning: This is about the greater (own personal) goal the student want to achieve.

We can conclude that it is possible to get motivated and involved students. It does not come naturally and the teacher plays an important role. The success lies in the combination of the student, teacher and learning activities. A student should be able to take their role and responsibility. That requires that the learning activities, besides the content of the course, should focud on the development of the own responsibility of the student in the context of their own leanring performance and motivation.

## How could we motivate our students?
We have learned that teacher do have a big impact on the motivation and learning performance of our students. While we also known that a lot teachers experience motivation problems with students, we know that this is not an easy task. The self-determination theory of Rayan & Deci tells us that the learning performance improves when the autonomous motivation is enlarged. This can be accomplished by both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. When extrensic motivation focusses on showing the value and the purpose of the learning activities, the motivation of the student become autonomous. If this is the case, the student experiences the necissity of the learning activities to achieve their own higher learning goals. It means that the teacher need to show the importance of the learning activities to the students. Some examples you can think of to do this within your learning activities:
* Make a link with professional practice the students want to work in.
* Share experiences of the professional practice with the students.
* Important to have a good or improve the teacher and student relation
* Have a positive attitude to towards the students.
* Use relevant and challenging assignments.
* Involve students in their own learning process.

## Feedback has the most influence on learning performance.
Hattie shows in his research that feedback has the most influence on the learning performance of our students. It could have both positive and negative influence. To ensure that students stay motivated, it is important to give good feedback (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). The most effective way giving feedback is to strenghten the learning process related to the current learning goals. Do not give feedback about things the student is not busy with. Good feedback answers the following three questions:
1. Where am I going? (The Goals)
2. How am I going?
3. Where to next?

In order to give good feedback, the teacher needs to be prepared very well. Starting learning activities for students require clear lesson/learning goals, importance of the lesson, link with the profesional practice, clear expectations, relevant challenging assignments, good relationship with the student, good class management, clear structure and promote autonomous motivation. When this is in place, the teacher is able to give good feedback AND the student is able to recieve the feedback by seeing how it relates to the context.

## Conclusion
A lot to digest. Within this section we try to answer the question "How can we get motivated students?". We do have learned that the teacher can do a lot. Within the context of the development of coding skills, we should focus on feedback. No rewards must be giving in terms of nice green flags or money! Rewards could be given in the form of the progress of the student. Giving ansers to the questions of good feedback: "where am I going", "how am I going" and "where to next". Furthermore, it is required to have clear learning goals, showing the importance of the learning activity, give the link with the professional practice, giving clear expectations, give relevant challenging assignment and promote autonomous motivation. 

# 2. What are effective education strategies to learn coding skills.
The teacher plays an important role in the learning performance of the students. That means that any digital tool is a tool for the teacher to support this learing performance. Within this section we are going to explore what effective education strategies are to learn to code. It is generally known that learning skills requires practice. This is also found by a desik research on the Internet. To become a expert programmer you need to program daily for five years (Forest, 2019). Forest also tells that focus needs to be on the practice and litte on the theory. Advicing a 80/20 rule of thumb. When concepts are studied, you need to put it into practice multiple times. Project based learning, is about solving problems of a relevant project to learn coding. Programming is not about learning a language, but about solving problems (Upadhyay, 2020). Also Upadhyay advices to learn concepts and theory and put it in practice afterwards. Project based approach is also discussed as a good approach to put the learned fundamentels into practice. The rule of thumb here is two hours study and one hour practice. It not fully in line with the "practice ... practice ... practice". To become a good programmer, it is required to learn to brak down complex problems into smaller pieces (Pronschinske, 2020). Learning coding is really hard and teaching is even harder. Most teachers come from a software background (Harris, 2019).

## Conclusion
Effective learning strategies is to learn the concepts and theory and immediatly start practicing. A rule of thump could be around 30/70 percent. The teacher could teach a concept and after that give the studentsn some examples to explore the concept in practice. Based on how students are performing, it is possible to give good feedback to show the students where they are in their learning process.

# 3. How can a digital tool support these effective education strategies to learn coding skills?
Supporting students to effectively coding skills, we need to motivate the students to practice a lot. As we have learned by answering the first research question, it starts with the teacher and the tool needs to provide additional support. The following aspects needs to be provided by both the teacher and the tool:
* Make a link with professional practice the students want to work in.
* Share experiences of the professional practice with the students.
* Important to have a good or improve the teacher and student relation
* Have a positive attitude to towards the students.
* Use relevant and challenging assignments.
* Involve students in their own learning process.

The following sections will describe more details about the specific subjects mentioned above.

## Make a link with professional practice the students want to work in
The teacher should tell the students in what way the lesson and module is connected to the proffesional practive. Why is this lesson required for the student. And more importantly, how should the students learns this in the best way. For programming a lot of practice is required. The tool should support the connection with the professional practice. When a new learning subject is started, the tool should give an introduction about the subject. Within this introduction, the connection with the professional practice should be clear. As an example, to become a great programmer, you need to have a good basis. Therefore, we start with the basic syntax and practice with simple algorithms before we dive deeper into the programming language. 

## Share experiences of the professional practice with the students
Be an enthousiast teacher! Tell stories about your experience within the professional practice. The tool could support this by anekdotes. It is not required, but the tool could tell something like "Did you know?" or "In the practice we use a lot of...".

## Important to have a good or improve the teacher and student relation
Make sure the students feel free to make mistakes. Students need to see learning programming as a big challenge and learning road. This road is not alway easy to drive and learning programming is not always easy. During the lectures and assignment, make sure that you connect with the students and ask how they feel and how they are doing. Support the students positively on the quest to become a great programmer!

## Have a positive attitude to towards the students
This is a bit the same as the previous subject. Be always positive and open to students. Eveything is good! Don't let the student fall, stay supportive and give feedback based on the learning (Hattie & Timperley, 2007).

## Use relevant and challenging assignments
While the tool will provide the challenging assignments, it is required to provide challenging assignments. The tool should be able to differentiate as well. Making sure, that the assignemts are not becoming too challenging. Students that require a bit more practice ona subject, they should get more practice. Based on the outcome of the assignments, the tool should decide which assignment should be next. That means that the teacher need to create a lot of assignments for all level of students. Only then students are able to do asssignment on their own challenging level.

## Involve students in their own learning process
In order to involve students in their own learning process, it is required to know where they are? Feedback to the students is essential. This can be done by the teacher off course. While the tool is also able to show statistics about how well a student is doing. Eventually, the teacher is eventually responsible. This teacher can use the statistics of the tool and encourage the student to go forward or pay attention on different aspects. For the tool, it would be nice that the student is able to see how well he or she is doing for the particular subject. Some kind of level. Furthermore, it is important to note that the student does not need the best level. When the students reaches some level after x time and y assessments, the tool could ask the student to go forward to the next subject. In a dashboard the student is able to see where some extra attention is needed.

## Conclusion
The conclusion is that the tool is not able to take over the teaching to the students. Teachers play an important rol in the learning of the student and is eventually responsible. The tool should support the teacher to increase the efficiency of the learning of the student. Most important is that the students recieves feedback to know where he or she stands in their own learning process. Some kind of level could be given to the student. The teacher is able to give feedback on the information of the tool. Wihtin the tool, the student can be given the issues that the tool found in the software code. Furthermore, the tool is able to show examples how the problem could have been solved. This can be done by videos. To determine the level of the student, 5 assignments can be given with points and a level can be derived. Time could also be used. If a student solves the assignment very fast, you know that the student understand the subject. When a students takes more time, he or she finds the assignment difficult. Therefore, time should be logged for each assignment.
